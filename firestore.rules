/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Agent Mission Management application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to the 'agents' and 'missions' collections
 * but restricts write access to prevent unauthorized data modification. No authentication is required to read these collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of two top-level collections: 'agents' and 'missions'.
 *  - /agents/{agentId}: Stores agent profiles.
 *  - /missions/{missionId}: Stores mission details.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Agents and Missions are publicly readable, but only writeable in the Firebase Console.
